## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're the Bioinformatics Team at the Tufts University Center for Cellular Agriculture

This organization will eventually be home to repos from bioinformatics publications
published here at TUCCA, as well as open source templates for bioinformatics
workflows relevant to our work in cellular agriculture.
